    "text": "A Romanian priest and four nuns have been charged in the death of a reportedly schizophrenic nun who was crucified in an exorcism. The novice, Maricica Irina Cornici, of Holy Trinity convent in northeast Romania, died last week after spending three days gagged and chained to a cross without food or water in the church\u2019s cellar.\nThe 23-year-old nun was found with a towel stuffed into her mouth and had been left in the cold room while the priest delivered prayers to drive out evil spirits. An initial autopsy revealed the nun died from dehydration, exhaustion and lack of oxygen. Prosecutors are awaiting the results of a second autopsy, which is being carried out because of a suspicion of foul play.\nThe priest, Daniel Petru Corogeanu, and four nuns have been charged with imprisonment leading to death. They could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Father Daniel told local news that he was trying to \"take the devil out of her\". When asked whether the nun was in need of medical help instead of an exorcism, he replied, \"You can't take the devil out of people with pills.\"\nMs. Cornici, who grew up in an orphanage, is said to have entered the remote convent three months earlier. There has been speculation by the Romanian media that Ms. Cornici's schizophrenic behaviour may have caused her fellow nuns and the priest to believe she was possessed by the devil.\nThe Orthodox Church has condemned the incident and suspended Father Daniel, who has refused to stop work at the Holy Trinity monastery. Riot police had to intervene when scuffles broke out as nuns yelled at a vicar who came to suspend Father Daniel on Sunday.",

    "text": "Organizers of the upcoming London Live 8 concert have announced that legendary rock band Pink Floyd plans to perform on July 2. Guitarist David Gilmour, bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and keyboardist Richard Wright will play their first performance together since playing at Earls Court, London in 1981.\nThe band will come together, along with other musical acts such as Coldplay, Elton John, and Paul McCartney for this event. Live 8 is a series of free concerts at each of the G8 nations organized by Bob Geldof. These concerts, set on the 20th anniversary of Geldof's Live Aid, have been planned to support the Make Poverty History campaign, which aims to reduce African poverty.\nThis lineup of Pink Floyd has not played together for 24 years due to a conflict between David Gilmour and Roger Waters over leadership and creative influence of the band. However, it seems that they are willing to put their differences behind to support Live 8; \"Like most people I want to do everything I can to persuade the G8 leaders to make huge commitments to the relief of poverty and increased aid to the third world,\" said David Gilmour and added, \"Any squabbles Roger and the band have had in the past are so petty in this context, and if reforming for this concert will help focus attention then it's got to be worthwhile.\"",

The report outlines an agenda for the country to make it a leading sustainable economy, focusing on efficiency improvement, eliminating waste and pollution, and developing sustainable urban centers.\nThe event, presented by Jack Layton and sponsored by the New Democratic Party of Canada, will be held on April 2nd, 2005 at Convocation Hall on the University of Toronto campus, Ontario.",

    "text": "Turkish investigators have connected sixteen more people to the havoc of the Zotob internet worm, which has been adversely affecting computers for the last two weeks. These people were found by analysing communications between them and the two hackers arrested four days ago.\nBy analysing the code of the Zotob worm, as well as its derivative works, law enforcement officials have found that three internet gangs were involved in the creation of the worm. Farid Essebar, aka 'Diab10', the 18 year old who wrote the worm, as well as others, like Mytob, was a member of the gang '0x90-Team'. The other gangs, 'BlackCarder' and 'MetalHit', wrote some of the variants of Zotob and Mytob.\nThe other of the two men arrested four days ago was 21 year old Attila Ekici. Turkish officials say that he was paid by Essebar to distribute Zotob. This type of financial relationship confirms theories that writing viruses has become a profit-making enterprise.",
